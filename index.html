  <h2>1. What I Love and Hate Doing</h2>

  <h3>ðŸŒŸ Love Doing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focused Teamwork:</strong> Collaborating with passionate teams
      on clear, meaningful objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Purposeful Impact:</strong> Tackling critical issues such as AI
      alignment, environmental sustainability, mental health, obesity,
      healthcare improvement, and elevating human well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Engagement:</strong> Being fully absorbed in meaningful
      tasks driven by genuine passion.</li>
    <li><strong>Leveraging Unique Talents:</strong> Roles blending my skills in
      juggling, music, and technology, with dedicated time for daily practice,
      community orchestra involvement, chamber music, and hobbyist activities,
      funded adequately to maintain passion (e.g., a replaceable but quality
      instrument like a $1,800 viola, or a $10,000 AI home lab; a home with a
      stage area where I can invite friends and performers to play). I'd love
      to host concerts in one of my homes like John Harbison does.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Growth Environment:</strong> Regularly learning from
      respected mentors and leaders, happily being the least experienced,
      skilled, and intelligent person in the room.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthy, Resilient Culture:</strong> Distinctive workplaces
      promoting genuine employee health and longevity through practical
      initiatives like science-based personal training, plant-based diets,
      adequate rest, and meaningful rewards (cash bonuses, vacations).</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborative and Inspired Coworkers:</strong> Colleagues who
      maintain peak health, pursue meaningful hobbies, and actively engage in
      personal growthâ€”especially those passionate about juggling.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimized Remote Work:</strong> Embracing remote environments
      designed for peak health and longevity, minimal unnecessary meetings or
      commuting, ideally a 32-hour, four-day workweek. Occasional face-to-face
      retreats that include camping or hiking trips would be okay. Working
      alongside competent, exciting individuals who are positively oriented,
      healthy, and high-achieving. I want seeing my co-workers to be an amazing
      experience. Convening at cutting-edge tech conferences or similar for
      special occasions, on the company dollar.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychologically Advanced Organizations:</strong> Valuing
      cutting-edge psychological research, openly encouraging truth-seeking
      dialogues, and celebrating evolving opinions based on evidence.
      Supportive of mental health. Antiauthoritarianism.</li>
    <li><strong>Meaningful Outcomes:</strong> Engaging in work producing
      tangible, impactful results addressing critical societal issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ðŸš« Hate Doing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meaningless Tasks:</strong> Jobs with arbitrary goals lacking
      personal significance; false promises of autonomy undermined by constant
      criticism.</li>
    <li><strong>Fear Based Cultures: </strong> Fearing all your choices because
      you know there is nothing you can do that will not be unfairly criticized.
      Immediate firing rather than constructive feedback and growth through
      learning. Poorly implemented frameworks such as performance reviews based
      on arbitrary metrics. IBM Design Thinking principles or Agile methodologies
      implemented in a way that has the opposite effect of their intent.</li>
    <li><strong>Harmful Work:</strong> Developing or promoting
      products/services negatively impacting society, including fast food,
      environmental harm, isolation-promoting technology, and weapons
      (especially wartime AI).</li>
    <li><strong>Incompetent Hierarchies:</strong> Arbitrary power structures
      managed by demonstrably incompetent leaders.</li>
    <li><strong>Passionless Roles:</strong> Positions filled by uninspired
      individuals compelled by necessity rather than genuine interest, fostering
      resentment and stagnation.</li>
    <li><strong>Toxic Micromanagement:</strong> Cultures demanding sudden
      overtime, prioritizing immediate fixes over long-term, preventative
      solutions; rewarding "heroic" reactions to preventable emergencies
      rather than those who do careful work and do not cause the problems in
      the first place.</li>
    <li><strong>Replaceable Roles:</strong> Generic positions treating workers
      as expendable and interchangeable, lacking recognition of individual
      skills.</li>
    <li><strong>Unhealthy Corporate Cultures:</strong> Environments emphasizing
      the grind to an unhealthy and counterproductive degree. Cultures where
      employees burn themselves out without much to show for their effort.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Challenges:</strong> Workplaces discouraging open
      and safe communication. I need to safely express myselfâ€”even during
      extreme situationsâ€”without career derailment. Employers should recognize
      and accommodate my mental health needs, even intervening proactively in
      crisis scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Unrealistic Expectations:</strong> Ambiguous roles with
      impossible goals, resistant to feedback or realistic adjustments.</li>
    <li><strong>Pointless Participation:</strong> Engaging in tasks without
      meaningful impact, feeling like participation in a meaningless cult.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Your "Must-Haves"</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Work from Home:</strong> I want to be a global citizen,
      attending the EJC every year, owning property abroad, being able to find
      love wherever it finds me. I want to be location independent. I want to
      be able to play my instruments, eat my own food, and have my own work
      setup. I want to redefine what it means to work. I want work to be an
      activity done to improve health and wellness, as well as for financial
      security.</li>
    <li><strong>High Salary:</strong> I am entering my 2nd decade of experience
      as a technology professional. I must maintain the progress I have made in
      my income by continuing to earn over $100,000/year. By the end of my 2nd
      decade, I would like to be making $200,000 or more. Otherwise I would
      rather not work in tech at all. I'd rather be a professional viola
      player, juggler, or some other creative pursuit. For low pay, I would
      rather not work in tech at all.</li>
    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> I am 100% sold on the coming
      AI revolution. I believe it will be more significant than anything we've
      experienced before in humanity. It will be like the invention of fire.
      We will have the "feel the AGI" moment around 2027, and I want to be one
      of the "asses in seats" at the table of that moment. I want to be the
      Ford assembly line worker driving my Model-T around past everyone else
      riding in their horse carriages.</li>
    <li><strong>Diversified Income:</strong> I'd like to work with people that
      are monetizing other things they do on the side. I'd love to get paid for
      my creative endeavors and passions. It's been my dream since I was a
      child to get paid to play the viola, but even after having invested
      $10,000 on an instrument, well over $20,000 or more on music education,
      and hours and hours practicing and performing, I PAY to play viola for
      people. I pay dues to a community orchestra and for instrument
      maintenance. I pay over $100/month to play music right now, if you
      include my Zimbabwean band. I have never gotten paid enough to offset my
      costs. I'm a highly skilled musician and juggler, but I currently pay to
      juggle and to make music, rather than getting paid for it. I feel like
      I'm in a parallel universe where the things I love are devalued. I can
      feel the harm this does in our society, and it frustrates me. Imagine if
      everyone who smokes cigarettes instead carried with them juggling balls
      or a tin whistle, and paid into those activities the same amounts they
      pay into smoking cigarettes. I think society would be better.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect for the Arts:</strong> It boggles my mind how
      undervalued fine arts are in U.S. culture. A must have in my next job is
      a company that openly values and supports artists. A great example would
      be a robotics company that tries to mimic great violin players. I love
      how AlphaGo brought attention to the game of Go. I want my job to immerse
      me in a historic, long-standing subculture of humanity. It'd be awesome
      to be associated with the juggling world since I'm immersed in it
      already. A fun idea is a non-grifting health-span longevity company that
      uses juggling skill as a metric for aging.</li>
    <li><strong>Organic Intelligence:</strong> I want to work with intelligent
      people who do the smartest thing by default without overthinking. I want
      to avoid working with self-described "nightmare people."</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> I want to do something big. I want to be part
      of the AI revolution.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr/>

  <h2>3. Your "Must-Nots"</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authoritarianism:</strong> "Because the boss said so" is not
      enough reasonâ€”especially for things like overtime and micromanagement. I
      cannot be told Friday afternoon that I'm working Saturday. Unacceptable,
      especially if it's to address preventable fallout from poor
      organizational choices. A "yes sir" environment is not right for me. I
      want an environment of "why."</li>
    <li><strong>Penny-Pinching Companies:</strong> Companies that give 2.98%
      raises to underperformers and 3.35% to top performers. I want
      organizations not baked into bloated hierarchies (e.g. four layers of
      VPs, Network Engineer I--V roles) where a junior engineer makes more than
      a senior due to arbitrary caps and freezes, and career advancement simply
      means having another title and not much else.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Described Nightmare People:</strong> I want everyone I work
      with to be objectively awesome. If anyone on the team is a nightmare
      person, I want it to be me.</li>
    <li><strong>Evil:</strong> Grifting, exploitation, cruelty, war profiteering
      (though I'm interested in drone tech).</li>
    <li><strong>Stupid Needless Companies:</strong> For example, health insurers
      when we could have single-payer. I don't want to work for the problem; I
      want to work for the solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard American Culture:</strong> I don't want to be rewarded
      by pizza, wings, and cake. I think a co-op, democracy-based sort of work
      model where my uniqueness is a valued asset and my vote counts would be
      ideal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Your Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Ability:</strong> I have a genuine passion for
      technology and a strong aptitude for learning new skills that enhance my
      work.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Network Engineering Expertise:</strong> 10 years of
      networking experience. Passed the CCNP Enterprise and JNCIP Service
      Provider exams. Attempted JNCIE.</li>
    <li><strong>Life Long Learner:</strong> Nearly 1000 educational videos
      posted on my 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg3oUjrSYcqsL9rGk1g_lPQ">YouTube channel</a>,
      covering a wide range of topics from networking to
      Python programming to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction.</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership & Mentorship:</strong> I volunteer for the
      <a href="https://agile-learning.institute/">Agile Learning Institute</a>,
      a free non-profit coaching service. I worked as a teaching assistant
      while in networking school.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Realist: </strong>I have
      <a href="https://situational-awareness.ai/">situational awareness</a> of
      the decade ahead regarding the impact of AI development. I participate on
      <a href="https://huggingface.co/gpaasch">Hugging Face</a> and use AI
      everyday to improve my life, especially for mental health.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> I am a core member of the
      <a href="https://juggling.place.org/">Texas Juggling Society</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.ctmorchestra.org/">Central Texas Medical Orchestra</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Awknowledgment of Weakness: </strong> I recognize that I have
      areas for growth, particularly regarding my disability diagnoses. I
      actively research and implement strategies to address these
      challenges. I regularly see relevant, licensed, and qualified
      professionals for support. I do my best to be a good patient and not
      have any unforced errors in my treatment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Connectiveness:</strong> I am mired by a number of mental
      health challenges, which makes me the perpetual odd man out. Included in
      my diagnoses is excoration disorder, which can be upsetting for others to
      witness. Since my number one value is health, physical and mental, I take
      my well-being seriously and seek environments that support it, which can
      limit my opportunities. I lack a clear and consistent mental model of which
      environments are conducive to my success and which are not.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Cloud Experience:</strong> Primarily on-prem networking
      background, with limited hands-on cloud experience (AWS, Azure, GCP).
      Actively working to close this gap through self-study and labs, but finding
      myself mired with challenges in motivation to study.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Software Best-Practice Experience:</strong> Much of my
      coding has been "glue and duct tape." The difference between my education
      in networking and in coding is stark. I am actively improving code
      quality and testing skills via autodidactic means, but I struggle to feel
      confident in my abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Selective Opportunity Focus:</strong> Strong preferences (remote
      work, values alignment, health management compatibility) limit immediate
      opportunities. May not align well with what the job market has to offer,
      especially in the fields where I have the most qualifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Career Goals (Short-Term and Long-Term)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short-Term Career Goal - Pivot Away from Traditional Network
      Engineering:</strong> Transition into modern future proof roles like
      AI Engineering, AI Infrastructure, Cloud Engineering, or Cyber Security.
      Use AI to make enough profit from a micro-saas or other sort of vibe
      coded project to collect a sort of "universal basic income" that
      allows me to work on my passions without worrying about financial security.
    <li><strong>Long-Term Vision - Entrepreneurship and Leadership:</strong>
      Start my own ai-native tech company that reflects my values, with a world-class
      people-first culture and a remote-first approach that innovates and
      redefines what it means to work. Innovate and create a highly lucrative
      and profitable niche that leverages the AI revolution, especially for the 
      application of the ability for AI to teach humans. For example, adult
      music lessons. People may find themselves drawn to learning music in a
      more personalized and flexible way, using AI-driven tools and platforms
      that cater to their individual needs and preferences. They might have more
      time and resources to devote to practice and skill development for their
      own personal satisfaction, if AI delivers upon its promises, leading to a
      highly profitable niche area for a business. A VR video gaming company
      could leverage AI to create personalized gaming experiences that improve
      people's lives on a fundamental level. Trauma reversing experiences. I am 
      inspired by 
      <a href="https://voyageaustin.com/interview/community-highlights-meet-john-mcclellan-of-andromeda-entertainment/">
      John McClellan</a>, who shares a lot of similar passions as me and who I 
      have spent a lot of time juggling with, but I am concerned that my past
      failures with education and direction may have hindered my ability to
      achieve similar success. I believe in education. I think continuing my 
      formal education may be an important step forward.</li>
