  <h2>1. What I Love and Hate Doing</h2>

  <h3>🌟 Love Doing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focused Teamwork:</strong> Collaborating with passionate teams on clear, meaningful objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Purposeful Impact:</strong> Tackling critical issues such as AI alignment, environmental sustainability, mental health, obesity, healthcare improvement, and elevating human well‑being.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Engagement:</strong> Being fully absorbed in meaningful tasks driven by genuine passion.</li>
    <li><strong>Leveraging Unique Talents:</strong> Roles blending my skills in juggling, music, and technology, with dedicated time for daily practice, community orchestra involvement, chamber music, and hobbyist activities, funded adequately to maintain passion (e.g., a replaceable but quality instrument like a $1,800 viola, or a $10,000 AI home lab; a home with a stage area where I can invite friends and performers to play). I’d love to host concerts in one of my homes like John Harbison does.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Growth Environment:</strong> Regularly learning from respected mentors and leaders, happily being the least experienced, skilled, and intelligent person in the room.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthy, Resilient Culture:</strong> Distinctive workplaces promoting genuine employee health and longevity through practical initiatives like science‑based personal training, plant‑based diets, adequate rest, and meaningful rewards (cash bonuses, vacations).</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborative and Inspired Coworkers:</strong> Colleagues who maintain peak health, pursue meaningful hobbies, and actively engage in personal growth—especially those passionate about juggling.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimized Remote Work:</strong> Embracing remote environments designed for peak health and longevity, minimal unnecessary meetings or commuting, ideally a 32‑hour, four‑day workweek. Occasional face‑to‑face retreats that include camping or hiking trips would be okay. Working alongside competent, exciting individuals who are positively oriented, healthy, and high‑achieving. I want seeing my co‑workers to be an amazing experience. Convening at cutting‑edge tech conferences or similar for special occasions, on the company dollar.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychologically Advanced Organizations:</strong> Valuing cutting‑edge psychological research, openly encouraging truth‑seeking dialogues, and celebrating evolving opinions based on evidence. Supportive of mental health. Antiauthoritarianism.</li>
    <li><strong>Meaningful Outcomes:</strong> Engaging in work producing tangible, impactful results addressing critical societal issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🚫 Hate Doing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meaningless Tasks:</strong> Jobs with arbitrary goals lacking personal significance; false promises of autonomy undermined by constant criticism.</li>
    <li><strong>Harmful Work:</strong> Developing or promoting products/services negatively impacting society, including fast food, environmental harm, isolation‑promoting technology, and weapons (especially wartime AI).</li>
    <li><strong>Incompetent Hierarchies:</strong> Arbitrary power structures managed by demonstrably incompetent leaders.</li>
    <li><strong>Passionless Roles:</strong> Positions filled by uninspired individuals compelled by necessity rather than genuine interest, fostering resentment and stagnation.</li>
    <li><strong>Toxic Micromanagement:</strong> Cultures demanding sudden overtime, prioritizing immediate fixes over long‑term, preventative solutions; rewarding “heroic” reactions to preventable emergencies rather than sustainable improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Replaceable Roles:</strong> Generic positions treating workers as expendable and interchangeable, lacking recognition of individual skills.</li>
    <li><strong>Unhealthy Corporate Cultures:</strong> Environments emphasizing long hours over true productivity, health, and well‑being (“work hard, play hard” attitudes instead of “work smart”).</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Challenges:</strong> Workplaces discouraging open and safe communication. I need to safely express myself—even during extreme situations—without career derailment. Employers should recognize and accommodate my mental health needs, even intervening proactively in crisis scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Unrealistic Expectations:</strong> Ambiguous roles with impossible goals, resistant to feedback or realistic adjustments.</li>
    <li><strong>Pointless Participation:</strong> Engaging in tasks without meaningful impact, feeling like participation in a meaningless cult.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Your “Must‑Haves”</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Work from Home:</strong> I want to be a global citizen, attending the EJC every year, owning property abroad, being about to find love wherever it finds me. I want to be location independent. I want to be able to play my instruments, eat my own food, and have my own work setup.</li>
    <li><strong>High Salary:</strong> I am entering my 2nd decade of experience as a technology professional. I must maintain the progress I have made in my income by continuing to earn over $100,000/year. By the end of my 2nd decade, I would like to be making $200,000 or more. Otherwise I would rather not work in tech at all. I’d rather be a professional viola player, juggler, or some other creative pursuit.</li>
    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> I am 100% sold on the coming AI revolution. I believe it will be more significant than anything we’ve experienced before in humanity. It will be like the invention of fire. We will have the “feel the AGI” moment around 2027, and I want to be one of the “asses in seats” at the table of that moment. I want to be the Ford assembly line worker driving my Model‑T around past everyone else riding in their horse carriages.</li>
    <li><strong>Diversified Income:</strong> I’d like to work with people that are monetizing other things they do on the side. I’d love to get paid to play the viola. It’s been my dream since I was a child. Currently, after spending $10,000 on an instrument, well over $20,000 or more on music education, and hours and hours practicing for personal satisfaction, I PAY to play viola for people. I pay dues to a community orchestra and another band. I pay about $150/month to play music right now. I get paid ZERO. Nothing about that makes sense. I’m a good player, even with my flaws. Music has value.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect for the Arts:</strong> It boggles my mind how undervalued fine arts are in U.S. culture. A must have in my next job is a company that openly values and supports artists. A great example would be a robotics company that tries to mimic great violin players. I love how AlphaGo brought attention to the game of Go. I want my job to immerse me in a historic, long‑standing subculture of humanity. It’d be awesome to be associated with the juggling world since I’m immersed in it already. A fun idea is a non‑grifting health‑span longevity company that uses juggling skill as a metric for aging.</li>
    <li><strong>Organic Intelligence:</strong> I want to work with intelligent people who do the smartest thing by default without overthinking. I want to avoid working with self‑described “nightmare people.”</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> I want to do something big. I want to be part of the AI revolution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Your “Must‑Nots”</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authoritarianism:</strong> “Because the boss said so” is not enough reason—especially for things like overtime and micromanagement. I cannot be told Friday afternoon that I’m working Saturday. Unacceptable, especially if it’s to address preventable fallout from poor organizational choices. A “yes sir” environment is not right for me. I want an environment of “why.”</li>
    <li><strong>Penny‑Pinching Companies:</strong> Companies that give 2.98% raises to underperformers and 3.35% to top performers. I want organizations not baked into bloated hierarchies (e.g. four layers of VPs, Network Engineer I–V roles) where a junior engineer makes more than a senior due to arbitrary caps and freezes. The only recourse is to leave.</li>
    <li><strong>Self‑Described Nightmare People:</strong> I want everyone I work with to be objectively awesome. If anyone on the team is a nightmare person, I want it to be me.</li>
    <li><strong>Evil:</strong> Grifting, exploitation, cruelty, war profiteering (though I’m interested in drone tech).</li>
    <li><strong>Stupid Needless Companies:</strong> For example, health insurers when we could have single‑payer. I don’t want to work for the problem; I want to work for the solution. I’d love to work for a single‑payer advocacy or healthcare reform organization, not UnitedHealthcare.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard American Culture:</strong> I don’t want to be rewarded by pizza, wings, and cake. I think a co‑op, democracy-based sort of work model where my uniqueness is a valued asset and my vote counts would be ideal.</li>
  </ul>
